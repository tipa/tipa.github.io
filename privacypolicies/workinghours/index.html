        <!-- <p>
                WorkingHours does not collect, store, share or publish any personal information.
            </p> -->

        <h3>Usage analytics &amp; crash reporting</h3>
        <p>
            We use App Center to keep track of app usage, find bugs, and fix crashes. All information sent to App Center is anonymous and free of any user or contextual data.
        </p>

        <h3>Cloud Sync</h3>
        <p>
            You are able synchronize your WorkingHours data across devices using the Cloud Sync feature. When using this feature, your WorkingHours database is uploaded to your personal Cloud Storage (e.g. OneDrive or Google Drive). The data transfer is done using the official APIs of the respective Cloud services. We do not have access to your Cloud Storage or your database.
        </p>

        <h3>Background location access</h3>
        <p>
            When using the workplace arrival/departure detection in the Android or iOS app, the app accesses your location in the background in order to start/stop the timer accordingly. To protect your privacy, the app does not use this location data for any other purpose and does not store it or send it off the device.
        </p>

        <h3>Advertisement (Android app)</h3>
        <p>
            In WorkingHours for Android the Google Mobile Ads SDK is used in order to show advertisement banners to support the development of the app. The Google Mobile Ads SDK may access,
            store, process and share Cookies, device identifiers, your approximate location, your device type and other personal data.
        </p>
        <h4>Consent</h4>
        <p>
            Where legally required, the app will ask for your consent before accessing personal data. Once you've given your consent, you can change your choice in the app's "About" page.
        </p>
        <h4>Pro version</h4>
        <p>
            WorkingHours offers a paid "Pro version" which removes all advertisement banners and disables the usage of the Google Mobile Ads SDK and its collection of data. You can purchase the Pro version from within the app.
        </p>
