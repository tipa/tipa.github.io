        <h2>AtomicClock Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This privacy statement describes how AtomicClock collects and uses personal information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information.
        </p>

        <h3>Usage analytics &amp; crash reporting</h3>
        <p>
            We use App Center &amp; Sentry to keep track of app usage, find bugs, and fix crashes. All information sent to App Center &amp; Sentry is anonymous and free of any user or contextual data.
        </p>

        <h3>Advertisement</h3>
        <p>
            AtomicClock does not access any personal information directly. However, in AtomicClock for iOS and Android the Google Mobile Ads SDK is used in order to show advertisement banners to support the development of the app. The Google Mobile Ads SDK may access,
            store, process and share Cookies, device identifiers, your approximate location, your device type and other personal data.
        </p>
        <h4>Consent</h4>
        <p>
            Where legally required, the app will ask for your consent before accessing personal data. Once you've given your consent, you can change your choice in the app's "About" page.
        </p>
        <h4>Pro version</h4>
        <p>
            AtomicClock offers a paid "Pro version" which removes the advertisement banner and disables the usage of the Google Mobile Ads SDK in the app. You can purchase the Pro version from within the app.
        </p>
